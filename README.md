Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser â‚¬; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR".

## The Onion Router "Tor"

- Tor is an Internet browser which is modified from the Firefox 
- Tor web is anonymous commmunication tool over the internet
- Tor anonymizes the user in a way, that identifying and tracking users is difficult or even impossible.
- Tor hides the users true IP address when a user is surfing websites or sending emails.
- Tor browser is easy to download for free, and requires no technical skills. In theory anyone can anonymously surf in the net and communicate witout being identified.

## Intended use and the history of Tor

- The intention is to allow anonymous communication over the internet
- It is good way for communication for example businesses and persons who wants to keep the converesations private.
- Tor browser is very popular among the criminals, who can either commit or faciltate crimes there.
- Tor browser was originally developed by the US government in 2002, but it does not controlling it.
- Tor is practically not controlled by anyone, but open for anyone with technical skills to improve and test it.
- Tor gets inputs worldwide from the experts who's motivation is privacy to ensure the browser remains effective and relevant

## 2 ways of looking at the TOR

- One perspective is to forensically examine devices that have Tor installed. That way the investigation is focusing on the Tor artifacts and not the ongoing usage of it.
- Tor can run on Mac, Linux and Windows
- The second perspective is that if the suspected person is currently using it. That way the investigation is concentrating to capture communications in the dark net or by trying identify the suspect who is using Tor
- Some aspects of Tor use is currently unbreakable, but it doesn't mean that the methods are unbreakable in the future.

## How the The Onion Router Works?

- The Tor directs the route of the user's internet traffic trough random relays on the Internet.
- First the data is layered with elliptic curve cryptography. It is unbreakable with bruteforce at the moment.
- When the coded information goes into the initial relay (called "entry"), it loses one layer of encryption and moves on to the next relay (known as "middle").
- The middle relay removes another layer of encryption and transfers the coded data to the final relay (referred to as "exit").
- Then the exit relay links to the user's chosen destination using an unendoded connection.
- The exit relay don't know anything of the route traffic other than on single previous relay.
- A random route chooses a different entry, middle and exit relay every ten minutes, which makes it impossible to track, or at least almost.

## Couple important thins about Tor net

- The volunteers are runing the Tor network relays
- Anyone, also I could configure a server to be one of the relays used by countless users. It means, that my server simply remove one layer and forward to the next destination.
- That is why the IP addressess that are involved in Tor network are not necessarily the IP address what is looked for, because it can simply be one volunteer running a Tor relay.
- Anonymity has been strengthened with more users, making it hard to find users. Over 750 000 users are using Tor daily using over 6000 relays worldwide.
- The entry relay, or node is also the "guard", and it is picked up randomly and used only one time for the first encrypted hop.
- Then the random middle node must be chosen for the middle encrypted hop, which then send the encrypted data to the exit node, and then the exit node sends the same encrypted data to the target.
- There are over 6000 nodes from which the Tor client can choose, and around after 10 mins the Tor circuit changes the nodes among the thousands to choose again.
- Because of the anonymity between the nodes, been a volunteer on middle node is safe and can avoid being wrongly suspected based on IP addressess.

## Tracking criminals 

- Tor network is more than only using the web anonymously.
- It allows terrorists and other criminals such as pedofiles, drug sellers and users, and all other human trashes to comunicate, share files and attack without the possibility to get caught using the Tor network
- Practically every government is working on deanonymizing Tor to find terrorists and criminals, or trying to prohibit people from accessing the Internet
- The biggest weakness in Tor is the user.
- The user should not customize the browser, as it is preconfigured with security in mind
- Antoher thing to stay anonymous is, do not share your location. Many websites ask that, but should never allow.
- A user who wants to stay anomymous should not ever download videos and animation from internet, as they requires often plugins to be installed, because the same plugins can allow the true IP address collected
- There has been conducted for years on Tor to find identity users, vulnerabilities and decrypt data.
- Other methods include s gaining control of many entry and exit nodes as possible to identify users and correlate the traffic.
- On method is a Man-in-the-middle attack to bypass the security of users in Tor by injecting a capture service between the user and destination.
- The most popular way is to get the true IP-address when investigating in Internet. The thing is, that Tor makes it extremely difficult.
- Above, the methods are inefficient and may cause the risk for compromising, identifying the Tor user outside the Tor can be possible. The method of using every information from on-line and open-source can help to identify the dark net user
- That's why the breakthrogh may take a while and investigators need to wait that the criminal makes a mistake.
 
## Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

## 1.
- Tor is still working, what means that NSA is still not able to completely reveal the anonymity in Tor.
- Tor has not probably been broken at a cryptographic level either, because of its design of usage of the network traffic.

## 2.
- Criminals are not the only one's who are using Tor. For example military, activists, journalists and families are using it for safety, anonymousness and other reasons.

## 3. 
- There is not a military back door in the software.
- Tor is an open source, so anyone can go and check the code and see that there is nothing.

## 4.
- Nobody has been prosecuted for running Tor relay.
- Law enforcement can still contact you, if you are running an exit relay.
- You should not concider criminal activities in Tor network

## 5. 
- Tor is easy to use, just download the browser


a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

I googled tor net and the first choice was tor
![image](https://github.com/Eeva1/h6-Iceberg.tor-the-onionrouter/assets/149093822/61c681b6-336a-4217-84a6-da8a513a887e)

I had to think twice if I dare to download this, because this is my work computer, not my own...

But I did it :-) Isn't this almost the same than my moving VPN connection?

and now I'm on the other side, the dark side of the computer world.

The browser suggested for changing the language to English so that my surfing is even more private, so I changed.

I started browsing Tor... and searched first global arms dealers and was looking if there is a possibility to buy guns online, and yes there is. Actually I've never even checked from the internet, is there same kinds of online shops, so I don't know if this is some how different...

The first time when I tryed some online gun shop pages, I could not get in because I didn't have the permission, but then I found an arms dealer:

There is lots of different kinds of guns, and not even so expensive..

It's horrible how easy you can buy a gun in the USA. 

But I'm not interested of guns so I changed the subject to drugs and went for looking them :-D

b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment. search engine for onion sites, marketplace, fraud, forum,
a well known organization

c) Tor browser helps to hide my identity by encrypting my traffic and sending it through a series of randomly picked relays in the Tor. That way the data traces back to random Tor serves rather than me. 


d) What kind of the threat models could TOR fit? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)
